To create a BINANCE/TON bridge management service on a node, you need to implement a series of methods to handle the creation and bridging of wrapped tokens. Below are detailed steps and pseudocode for the methods listed:

1. create_ton_wrapped_token
This method creates a wrapped token from BNB to TON. It involves deploying a smart contract on the TON blockchain with the required methods (send, mintToAddress, burn).

Pseudocode:
python
Копировать код
def create_ton_wrapped_token(bnb_token_address):
    # Generate TON contract address
    ton_contract_address = deploy_ton_contract()
    
    # Deploy the contract with required methods
    deploy_contract_with_methods(ton_contract_address, methods=['send', 'mintToAddress', 'burn'])
    
    return ton_contract_address
Steps:
Generate a TON contract address.
Deploy the smart contract on TON blockchain with send, mintToAddress, burn methods.
Return the contract address.
2. bridge_token_to_ton
This method bridges a token from BNB to TON by receiving the token on the BNB chain and minting the same amount of the wrapped token on the TON blockchain, sending it to the specified TON address.

Pseudocode:
python
Копировать код
def bridge_token_to_ton(amount, bnb_contract_address, ton_address):
    # Step 1: Receive tokens on BNB chain
    received = receive_bnb_tokens(amount, bnb_contract_address)
    
    if received:
        # Step 2: Mint equivalent wrapped tokens on TON
        mint_to_ton(ton_address, amount)
        
        return True
    else:
        return False
Steps:
Receive tokens on the BNB chain.
Mint equivalent wrapped tokens on the TON blockchain.
Send the minted tokens to the specified TON address.
Return success status.
Sample Implementation (using Python-like pseudocode):
python

class BinanceTonBridge:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.ton_contracts = {}
        
    def create_ton_wrapped_token(self, bnb_token_address):
        ton_contract_address = self.deploy_ton_contract()
        self.deploy_contract_with_methods(ton_contract_address, ['send', 'mintToAddress', 'burn'])
        self.ton_contracts[bnb_token_address] = ton_contract_address
        return ton_contract_address
    
    def bridge_token_to_ton(self, amount, bnb_contract_address, ton_address):
        received = self.receive_bnb_tokens(amount, bnb_contract_address)
        if received:
            ton_contract_address = self.ton_contracts.get(bnb_contract_address)
            if ton_contract_address:
                self.mint_to_ton(ton_contract_address, ton_address, amount)
                return True
        return False
    
    def deploy_ton_contract(self):
        # Implement contract deployment logic here
        pass
    
    def deploy_contract_with_methods(self, contract_address, methods):
        # Implement method deployment logic here
        pass
    
    def receive_bnb_tokens(self, amount, contract_address):
        # Implement logic to receive tokens on BNB chain
        pass
    
    def mint_to_ton(self, ton_contract_address, ton_address, amount):
        # Implement minting logic on TON chain
        pass
Additional Implementation Details:
Security: Ensure proper security measures like transaction validation, address verification, and protection against double-spending.
Error Handling: Include comprehensive error handling for network failures, transaction issues, and unexpected behaviors.
Testing: Thoroughly test the bridge functionality on testnets before deploying to mainnet.
Next Steps:
Implement the actual blockchain interaction methods (deploy_ton_contract, deploy_contract_with_methods, receive_bnb_tokens, mint_to_ton).
Setup the environment to interact with both BNB and TON blockchains.
Deploy the bridge management service and monitor its operation.
Feel free to share additional details or specific requirements for a more tailored implementation.

Create function to deploy standart coin contract on TON chain with dynamic name and include methods: mint, mint_to, burn
ChatGPT
To deploy a standard coin contract on the TON blockchain with a dynamic name and include methods like mint, mint_to, and burn, you need to write a function that handles the contract deployment. This function will involve creating the contract's code, compiling it, and deploying it to the TON blockchain.

Here's an example function in Python that demonstrates how to achieve this. Note that actual implementation may vary based on the TON SDK or API you are using.

Example Implementation
1. Contract Code
First, define the smart contract code with placeholders for the dynamic name. For simplicity, we can define the contract in a separate file or within the script.

python
Копировать код
standard_coin_contract_code = """
pragma ton-solidity >= 0.35.0;
pragma AbiHeader expire;
pragma AbiHeader pubkey;

contract {name} {
    uint256 static _randomNonce;
    address static _walletAddress;
    mapping(address => uint128) _balances;

    event Mint(address indexed to, uint128 value);
    event Burn(address indexed from, uint128 value);

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.pubkey() == tvm.pubkey(), 101);
        tvm.accept();
        _;
    }

    constructor() public onlyOwner {
        _balances[_walletAddress] = 0;
    }

    function mint(uint128 value) public onlyOwner {
        _balances[_walletAddress] += value;
        emit Mint(_walletAddress, value);
    }

    function mint_to(address to, uint128 value) public onlyOwner {
        _balances[to] += value;
        emit Mint(to, value);
    }

    function burn(uint128 value) public {
        require(_balances[msg.sender] >= value, 102);
        _balances[msg.sender] -= value;
        emit Burn(msg.sender, value);
    }

    function getBalance(address addr) public view returns (uint128) {
        return _balances[addr];
    }
}
"""
2. Deployment Function
Next, define a Python function to deploy this contract with a dynamic name.

python
Копировать код
from ton_client.client import TonClient, DEVNET_BASE_URL
from ton_client.types import Abi, DeploySet, CallSet, Signer, ParamsOfEncodeMessage, ParamsOfProcessMessage

client = TonClient(config={"network": {"server_address": DEVNET_BASE_URL}})

def deploy_standard_coin_contract(contract_name):
    # Replace placeholder with dynamic contract name
    contract_code = standard_coin_contract_code.replace("{name}", contract_name)

    # Compile the contract
    compiled_contract = client.abi.compile_tvm(contract_code=contract_code, output=None)

    # Prepare the deploy message
    abi = Abi.from_path(path="path_to_abi.json")
    deploy_set = DeploySet(tvc=compiled_contract['code'])
    call_set = CallSet(function_name='constructor')
    signer = Signer.Keys(keys=client.crypto.generate_random_sign_keys())

    params = ParamsOfEncodeMessage(
        abi=abi,
        deploy_set=deploy_set,
        call_set=call_set,
        signer=signer
    )

    message = client.abi.encode_message(params=params)

    # Send the deploy message
    params_of_process_message = ParamsOfProcessMessage(
        message_encode_params=params,
        send_events=False
    )

    result = client.processing.process_message(params=params_of_process_message)

    return result.transaction

# Example usage
contract_name = "MyDynamicToken"
deploy_result = deploy_standard_coin_contract(contract_name)
print(deploy_result)
Explanation
Contract Code: The standard_coin_contract_code defines the Solidity contract with dynamic insertion of the name.
TonClient Setup: The TonClient is configured to connect to the TON network. Ensure you have the TON SDK installed and properly set up.
Deploy Function:
Replace the {name} placeholder in the contract code with the actual contract name.
Compile the contract.
Prepare the deployment message with DeploySet and CallSet.
Sign the message with a generated key.
Encode and send the deployment message to the TON blockchain.
Example Usage: The function deploy_standard_coin_contract is called with a dynamic contract name, and the deployment result is printed.
Additional Steps
ABI and Contract Compilation: Ensure the path to the ABI file and contract compilation methods are correctly set up based on your development environment.
TON SDK Configuration: Install and configure the TON SDK to work with your development environment.
Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling for network issues, contract compilation errors, and transaction failures.
By following these steps and adjusting the code based on your specific TON SDK or API, you can dynamically deploy a standard coin contract on the TON blockchain with the required methods.
